# OH HAI!

## Training a ML network on data that the model you are using is based on is a bad idea

### Archiving this to make more better networks 

# Truck Vs Rig Network

This network will classify a image of a truck or semi as a truck or a semi. 

## Why?

This is my first project for fast.ai's v3 course. 

## Data?

The data are images from the ImageNET dtaset, downloaded and cropped using a tool I created specifically to grab, crop, and scale images from the ImageNET dataset. For those who are interested, you can find out more about *grabber* [here](https://github.com/ScottVaverchak/ml-tools).
